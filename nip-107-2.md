Nostr Internet of Things 
-----------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:benarc` `author:blackcoffeebtc` `author:motorina0` `author:riccardobl`

## Rationale

The terms/conditions of IoT software/hardware is horrible. A user should be able to message a light or heating system and ask it to turn on/off. Nostr gives the simple, permissionless development environment IoT needs.


## Terms

- `user` - user operating IoT devices with NOSTR key-pair and a client made specifically for IoT
- `device` - device to operate over Nostr with NOSTR key-pair, using a microcontroller client like <a href="https://github.com/lnbits/arduino-nostr">nostr-arduino</a>
- `group` - a group of users or devices that can communicate with each other
- `group_secret` - a pre-shared private key used to encrypt events for a group of users or devices
- `group_id` - a unique identifier for a group (can be a random string)
- `input/output template` - [JSON-schema](https://json-schema.org/) template that defines the structure of the input/output of an action or state


## Nostr IoT Clients

### User

Where the `user` registers 'device'(s) and its keys, then updates the `device`(s).

### Device

The `device` uses a client like <a href="https://github.com/lnbits/arduino-nostr">nostr-arduino</a> to receive commands from the `user` or another `device`.
The `device` can also push data such as sensor readings and updates.

## Events

Devices and users communicate with each other using event formatted as json-rpc messages.

| Kind     |            | Description                      | NIP                                                                                     |
|----------|----------- |----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `20107`  | `config`   | Configure a device               | [NIP-107 Configure Device Event](#configure-device-event) |
| `30106`  | `discovery`| Announce the device              | [NIP-107 Device discoverability](#intent-events-kind-8000) |
| `8107`   | `intent `  | Trigger an action on a device    | [NIP-107 Intent Event](#intent-events-kind-8000) |
| `30107`  | `data`     | Publish data from a device       | [NIP-107 Data Event](#intent-events-kind-8000) |
| `8106`   | `logs`     | Publish logs from a device       | [NIP-107 Logs Event](#intent-events-kind-8000) |


The content of events can be transmitted in clear text (for public data) or encrypted with the group secret ([group encryption](#group-encryption)) or encrypted for a specific public key ([encryption](#encryption)).


### Remote configuration (`kind: 20107`) (optional)
---

Devices can support remote configuration by providing an admin connection url. This allows the user to configure the device without being physically present.

The admin url should be unique to each device and should be regenerated only when the device is manually reset (eg: by pressing the reset button, reflashing the firmware, etc).


The url has this format:
```
nostriot+admin://<admin-privkey>@<device-pubkey>?relay=relay-url&metadata=<optional nip 01 metadata>&template=<json-schema>
```

| Param                    |  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     
| `admin-privkey`          | the hex encoded nostr private key that must be used to sign the `config` event             
| `device-pubkey`          | the hex encoded nostr public key of the device
| `relay-url`              | the relay where the device is listening for `config` events (there can be multiple relay params)
| `metadata` (optional)    | nip-01 metadata used for visualization purposes (eg. to show the device name in the UI)
| `json-schema`            | a [JSON-schema](https://json-schema.org/) template that defines the structure of the configuration event content

**Event Content**:
```json
{
    "action": "config",
    "params": { ... } // json object built from the template
}
```


# Group joining

As part of the configuration phase, a device can be configured to join one or more groups by providing their group urls.

A group url is constructed as follows:

```
nostriot://<group-secret>@<group-id>?relay=relay-url&metadata=<optional nip 01 metadata>
```
| Param                    |  |
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------     
| `group-secret`           | a hex encoded nostr private key that represent tha shared secret of the group          
| `group-id`               | an unique identifier for the group (can be a random string or the public key derived from group-secret)
| `relay-url`              | the relay where the group communicates (there can be multiple relay params)
| `metadata` (optional)    | nip-01 metadata used for visualization purposes (eg. to show the device name in the UI)


# Encryption

Events can be encrypted for a specific public key (eg. the user sending the intent event) using nip-04.
When encrypting events for a specific public key, the `content` field is encrypted using the public key, and a `encrypted` tag is added to the event.

data events published in response to intent events should use encryption only if the intent event itself was encrypted.

data events published spontaneously by the devices should use [group encryption](#group-encryption).


# Group Encryption

Events can be encrypted for a group of users and devices using the same algorithm as **NIP-04**, but with a pre-shared private key, referred to as the *group_secret*.

When encrypting events for a group, the `content` field is encrypted using the `group_secret`, and a `nostriot/encrypted` tag is added to the event.

If **NIP-04** is used together with group encryption, encryption and decryption must be handled as follows:

- **Encryption:**   `nip_04(group_encrypt(content))`

- **Decryption:**  `group_decrypt(nip_04(content))`

data events published in response to intent events should use group encryption only if the intent event itself was group encrypted.

data events published spontaneously by the devices should always use group encryption unless the device is set to be public.



# Device discoverability (`kind: 30106`) (optional)

Devices periodically send a kind `30106` to make themselves discoverable by other devices and users in the same group, this can be encrypted with the `group_secret` ([group encryption](#group-encryption)) to authenticate the device to a group or plain text for public devices.

The event must be tagged with `d`,`group_id` and `client`,`nostriot` and its content should follow this structure:

```
{
    'title': 'Smart light', // name of the device
    'picture': '', // url to a icon of the device (optional)
    'description': '', // a brief description of what the device does (optional)
    'actions': {  // a key-value map of actions that can be performed on the device
        'turn_on': { // key is the id of the action
            'title': 'Tun on the light', // name of the action (optional)
            'picture': '', // url to a icon of the action (optional)
            'description': '', // a brief description of what the action does (optional)
            'inputs': { // json-schema representing the input template for the intent event (see [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/))
                'type': 'object',
                'properties': {
                    'color': { // key is the id of the input
                        'title': 'Color', // name of the input (optional)
                        'type': 'string', // type of the input 
                        'description': '', // a brief description of the input (optional)
                        'default': '#ffffff' // default value of the input (optional),
                    },
                }
                'required': ['color'] // list of required inputs
            },
            'outputs': { // json-schema representing the output template for the data event content (see [json-schema](https://json-schema.org/))
                'type': 'object',
                'properties': {
                    'status': { // key is the id of the output
                        'title': 'Status', // name of the output (optional)
                        'type': 'string', // type of the output 
                        'description': '', // a brief description of the output (optional)
                        'default': 'on' // default value of the output (optional),
                        'enum': ['on', 'off'] // list of possible values for the output
                    }
                },
                'required': ['status'] 
            },
            'tags': [ // optional tags for this action, used for filtering
                ['t', 'light'], 
            ]
        }
    },
    states: { // a key-value map of states the device can publish
        'power_status': { // key is the id of the state
            'title': 'Status', // name of the state (optional)
            'picture': '', // url to a icon of the state (optional)
            'description': '', // a brief description of what the state does (optional)
            'outputs': { // output template for the data event (see Input/Output templates)
                'type': 'object',
                'properties': {
                    'status': { // key is the id of the output
                        'title': 'Status', // name of the output (optional)
                        'type': 'string', // type of the output 
                        'description': '', // a brief description of the output (optional)
                        'default': 'on' // default value of the output (optional),
                        'enum': ['on', 'off'] // list of possible values for the output
                    }
                },
                'required': ['status'] 
            },
            'tags': [ // optional tags for this state, used for filtering
                ['t', 'light'], 
            ]
        }
     }
    'relays': [], // optional list of relay that should be used to communicate with the device
    'tags': [ // optional tags for this device, used for filtering
        ['t', 'light'], 
    ]
}
```


other devices and apps can discover devices by subscribing to events with `kind:30106` and `#d:group_id`. 
nb. encrypted events that fail the decryption should be discarded as invalid.


### Intent Events (`kind: 8107`)
---
Intent Events represent different actions that can be performed on a device. These actions can be triggered by a `user` or by another `device`.
The content of the event is a `JSON` object that contains an `action` field that is a string corresponding to the action to be performed and a `params` field that contains the input values for the action built from an input template

**Event Content**:
```json
{
   "action": "turn_on",
   "params": {
      "color": "#ffffff"
   }
}
```

Intent events can be encrypted for the device public key (see [Encryption](#encryption)) or for the group secret (see [Group Encryption](#group-encryption)).

The response to an intent event is a [Data Event](#data-events-kind-30107) tagged with the `d` tag pointing event id of the intent event.

### Data Events (`kind: 30107`)
---
Data Events represent data published by `device`(s).
The content of the event is a `JSON` array that contains one or more `state` objects. Each `state` object contains a `state` field that is a string corresponding to the state being published, a `value` field that contains the value of the state built from an output template, and an optional `tags` field that contains tags for the state.

An optional `error` field can be added to the `state` object to indicate an error that occurred.

If the data event is a response to an intent event, it should be tagged with the `d` tag pointing to the event id of the intent event.
If the data event is published spontaneously by the device, it should be tagged with the `d` tag pointing to the `group_id` or to a random string if the device wishes to keep a state log.

If the data event is a response to an intent event, it should be encrypted using the same encryption method as the intent event (see [Encryption](#encryption) and [Group Encryption](#group-encryption)), otherwise it should be encrypted using the `group_secret` unless the device is set to be public, in which case it should be transmitted in clear text.

> [!NOTE]  
> If a device has more sensors attached (eg: temperature and humidity) then it cam publish one unified event for all measured values.

**Event Content**:
```json
[
    {
        "state": "power_status",
        "value": {
            "status": "on"
        },
        "tags": [ // optional tags for this state
            ["t", "light"]
        ],
        "error": null // optional error message
    }
]
```


### Logs Events (`kind: 8106`)
---

Logs Events represent logs published by `device`(s).
The content of the event is a `JSON` object that contains the log message, its severity level, and an optional `tags` field that contains tags for the log message.

**Event Content**:
```json
{
    "message": "Device turned on",
    "severity": "info",
    "tags": [ // optional tags for this log
        ["t", "light"]
    ]
}
```

Severities can be:
- `fatal`
- `error`
- `info`
- `warning`
- `debug`
- `fine`
- `finer`
- `finest`


log events can be either plain text or encrypted using [group encryption](#group-encryption) or [encryption](#encryption) depending on the device configuration.
